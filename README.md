Nirbhay:- An app which provides solution for anonymous reporting of drug trafficking for general public and helps the public in reporting of drug trafficking happening in their nearby places with the specialty of being anonymous.
If a person saw a dealer or someone who is drug trafficking he can report him via Nirbhay app where the user will be asked for details,location,extra attachments (audio,video,pictures),contact details of the culprit if available and extra details and via ML model we will identify false report or and if the report is from a high drug reported region or if the report having enough details on the basis of that we will cluster the priority and filter out the false report. And after receiving the report NCB can have further details from the user communicating via conversation chat box and it will help in gathering a lot of details to catch the culprit.
